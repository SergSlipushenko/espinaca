The module introduces cooperative ``multithreading`` for Nodemcu platform.
It works on top of callbacks and reuses system scheduler. Basically, it is
nothing more then converter callbacks to async/await-like interface. With this
module it is possible to do not-blocking sleeps `futures.sleep(1000)` and run 
a few io-waiting jobs in parallel:
`futures.spawn(dns_resovle); futures.spawn(send_http_req)`

Future class represents asynchronously getting data. Instead of callbacks
it allows to get async result in the same thread without blocking of internal 
system processes. Future.callbk set up callback function for retriving data 
and then Future.result waits for this callback and returns retrieved data from 
callback call.
IMPORTANT NOTE: Future.result will work properly only if function where it was
used was runned with future.spawn.
